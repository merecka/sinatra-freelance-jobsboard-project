Freelance Job Board Sinatra App - FlatIron Bootcamp Sinatra Project

This is a job board web application that I built using Sinatra which utilizes ActiveRecord to store & persist data to a SQLite database.  This app was built as a Sinatra project for the FlatIron Software Engineering bootcamp.

Purpose:
The purpose of this app is to be a job board posting application where Companies can sign up and post jobs and Users can sign up and apply to jobs.  All accounts and jobs are stored in a SQL database and passwords are securely protected.  

Instructions:
To use this app, clone it down from the GitHub repo (https://github.com/merecka/sinatra-freelance-jobsboard-project) and run 'bundle install' to install the required gem's list in the Gemfile.  Then start a webserver via shotgun and browse to the server IP address in your browser.  From there you can sign up as a User (aka:  Applicant) or an Owner (aka:  Company).  Company accounts can create, view, edit and delete Jobs.  Applicant accounts can view, apply, and unapply to Jobs.  

Contributions:
This app was written by myself, Alex Merecka.  Any and all contributions are welcome and feel free to contact me with any questions/suggestions/praise(LOL) at merecka@gmail.com.

Thanks and enjoy the app!
